// Foreign services describe the properties of services outside Istio. It
// contains a white-listed set of mesh-external domains and IP blocks that
// services in the mesh are allowed to access.
//
// If a foreign service expects HTTPS then that service can be accessed by
// application code using HTTP and the sidecar will originate TLS on its
// behalf. If the application has to originate TLS, the service should be
// declared as a TCP service and the sidecar will simply forward it as
// opaque TCP traffic.
//
// NOTE 1: If a foreign service has the same name as a service in the
// service registry, the foreign service's declaration will be given
// precedence.
//
// NOTE 2: There can be ONLY ONE ForeignServices configuration for the
// entire mesh.
//
// For example, the following foreign services configuration describes the
// set of services at https://*.foo.com:443 and http://example.bar.com:80.  Calls
// to *.foo.com are treated as opaque TCP calls as the application
// originates TLS. Calls to example.bar.com are treated as HTTP, as the
// application makes plaintext HTTP calls and expects the sidecar to
// originate TLS. The associated destination rule configures the sidecar to
// originate TLS when making the outbound call to example.bar.com.
